RESPONSE TO THE ACCIDENT
The Immediate Response
The Phillips fire brigade provided the initial emergency response, which included administering first aid to injured employees and fighting the fire with onsite equipment. The effort was augmented by local emergency response units including fire, police, and ambulance and by the Channel Industries Mutual Aid organization (ClMA). ClMA, a cooperative of approximately 106 members in the Houston area, which included industrial facilities, municipal fire departments, the U .S. Coast Guard, the County Sheriffs Department, and the County Fire Marshal's Office, was established to provide assistance to its members in emergency situations. This assistance included trained firefighting, rescue, and first-aid personnel and equipment. Command of the site and coordination of the response were under the control of the Phillips Complex fire chief.

EP A Region 6, headquartered in Dallas, was notified of the incident by the National Response Center at 3:27 p.m. after a concerned citizen made the initial report of the accident at 3:14 p.m. EPA Technical Assistance Team representatives were on scene within the hour and performed air monitoring at several locations downwind from the facility. No hydrocarbon concentrations above background levels were found. An EP A on-scene coordinator arrived at 4:30 p.m. to provide technical assistance to Phillips in emergency response procedures, and in accordance with the National Contingency Plan--the national emergency response plan developed by the 14-member interagency (NRT)--to ensure that the response measures were adequately protective of public health and the environment.
Phillips officials notified the Texas Air Control Board, the Harris County Pollution Control Board and the Community Awareness Emergency Response Program immediately following the explosion. The Federal Aviation Administration took steps to limit air traffic in the vicinity of the site, and the U.S. Coast Guard temporarily closed the Houston Ship Channel.
Firefighting
The Phillips Complex did not have a dedicated water system for fighting fires. Water for that purpose came from the same water system that was used for the chemical process. Consequently, when the process water system was extensively compromised by the explosion, the plant's water supply for fighting fires was also disrupted. Fire hydrants were sheared off in the blast, and because of ruptures in the system, water pressure was inadequate for firefighting needs. It was necessary to lay hose to remote water sources--settling ponds, a cooling tower, a water treatment plant, and a water main at a neighboring plant. Of the three backup diesel pumps that could have been used to provide water pressure to fight the fire, one had been taken out of service and was therefore unavailable, and another soon ran out of fuel and it, too, went out of service. Electric cables supplying power to regular service fire pumps were damaged by the fire, and those pumps were rendered inoperable. Nonetheless, the fire was brought under control within approximately 10 hours, with the help of several Phillips Complex fire trucks, which were able to pump foam on the fire, and with the assistance of firefighting equipment brought to the site by CIMA members and local fire departments.
Search and Rescue
Search and rescue efforts could not begin until daylight when the fire and the tremendous heat generated during the fire had subsided. These efforts were difficult because of the danger of structural collapse from the damage caused by the explosion. The U.S. Coast Guard and Houston fireboats evacuated more than 100 people from the facility and transported them across the Houston Ship Channel. These people had been in the Administration Building and would have had to cross the area of the explosion to reach safety had not the U .S. Coast Guard and fire department vessels been on the scene. The search was coordinated by the Harris County Medical Examiner and County Coroner. Any evidence that OSHA investigation personnel deemed useful in determining the cause of the accident was preserved during the search.

CHAPTER III
OSHA'S INVESTIGATION
OSHA's investigation was conducted by a team selected by the Regional Administrator from experienced field staff, including supervisors, industrial hygienists, and safety engineers, who were assisted by engineers from OSHA's national office and outside consultants. The team held an opening conference with officials of Phillips and of the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers Union COCA W) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers cmEW) prior to commencing a detailed inspection of the worksite.
The investigation into the causes of the accident was conducted concurrently with the investigation of possible violations of the OSH Act and involved the following activities: (1) obtaining scores of witness statements; (2) identifying and testing critical pieces of evidence from the debris; (3) reviewing thousands of pages of documentation; and ( 4) mapping the accident scene and documenting the condition of damaged or destroyed plant equipment.
Forty-six witnesses, who were identified as potential sources of valuable information about conditions at the plant immediately prior to the explosion, were interviewed by OSHA staff and the Harris County Fire Marshal's staff. Among those interviewed were four surviving eyewitnesses who were present at the point of the gas escape at the time of the event, but who managed to escape death. The other witnesses included Phillips plant supervisors, operators, maintenance and security personnel, and supervisory and maintenance personnel from the onsite contractor (Fish Engineering and Construction, Inc. ), which was responsible for maintenance activities at the complex.
The investigating team began photographing and videotaping the site while rescue operations were being conducted. OSHA personnel assisted in the search and rescue effort by providing information relating to critical safety issues. Immediately following the rescue operations, when OSHA investigators were first able to enter the accident site, they identified specific areas in the plant and equipment relevant to the investigation. These were isolated, and an extensive tagging and documentation operation was initiated to establish a chain of custody for evidence. Certain materials were removed by OSHA for laboratory tests.
In the course of the investigation, thousands of pages of documents relating to the facilities, equipment, and work practices at the complex were reviewed by OSHA compliance officers and engineers. Among these documents were process flow diagrams, instrumentation diagrams, maintenance records, standard operating procedures manuals, training manuals, and plant and corporate safety manuals.
